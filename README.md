# Proppy Plane
Proppy Plane is my first ever public game on Github. I created it mainly for two reasons:\
 to learn how to use Github, and to learn how to use the Godot game engine.

 The game itself is just a generic "Flappy Bird" copy\
 If you came across this repository you are either my friend or just have really good wandering skills.

 ## Current Features

* No textures yet apart from Godot's own icon.svg file. We going all function and no form as of yet.

* A game over screen that barely works and manages to not crash the game, nifty I would say.

* Continous upward propulsion instead of jumping, feel the air get thinner.

* An error the game throws when I restart after failure, it doesnt crash anything tho. It's just there to annoy me

## Future Ideas 
Or anything else that sounds even remotely interesting.

* Some kind of fuel system that you need to fly around and pick up if you want to keep flying

* A weapon system where you have to shoot obstacles like pillars with no gaps or barricades that block your path through the pillars
